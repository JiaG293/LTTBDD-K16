///Coding Challenge #4
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. 
//It's not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's easier for you, you can start with an 
//if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)

// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).
//Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”
