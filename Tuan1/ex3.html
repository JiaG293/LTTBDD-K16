      //3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
      //team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
      //score of at least 100 points.Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
      //score, as well as multiple else -if blocks
      //4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
      //both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
      //points.Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
